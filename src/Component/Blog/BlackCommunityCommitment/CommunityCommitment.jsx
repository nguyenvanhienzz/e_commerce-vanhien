                <h1>THE JORDAN BRAND COMMITMENT</h1>
                <p>Jordan Brand is of and by the Black Community. Bigger than one man,
                    whose will and work redefined the meaning of greatness.
                    Bigger than the basketball court, where generations of dreams have taken flight.
                    Bigger than any struggle, any obstacle, any fight.
                    The fight for equal opportunity and equal justice is ours.</p>
                <p>At the heart of the 10-year, $100 million Black Community Commitment,
                    announced by Michael Jordan and Jordan Brand in 2020,
                    is a desire to take action where it is needed most.
                    Today, Michael Jordan and the Jordan Brand are extending the impact of this commitment through a
                    total of $1 million in local grants awarded to our inaugural cohort of 18 Community Grantees.
                    These 18 grassroots organizations are on the front lines of change within their respective
                    communities, and we are proud to help champion their impactful work/ we are proud to amplify their impactful work.</p>
